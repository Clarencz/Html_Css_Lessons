# HTML & CSS  Resource

This repository contains the exact **HTML and CSS notes, code samples, and references** I personally use to teach HTML & CSS â€” whether during 1-on-1 lessons, workshops, or guided self-learning.

It's a growing collection of **simplified explanations**, **annotated code examples**, and **deep dives** into essential web development concepts.
