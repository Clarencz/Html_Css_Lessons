CSS Shadows
What Are Shadows in CSS?
CSS shadows are visual effects that simulate a shadow cast by an element or text — helping create a sense of depth, elevation, or focus in a flat web layout.

There are two types of shadows in CSS:
text-shadow: Applies shadow to text
box-shadow: Applies shadow to the element's box (container)

text-shadow — Shadow on Text
Syntax:
text-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur-radius color;
Parts Explained:
offset-x Horizontal shadow (right if positive, left if negative)
offset-y Vertical shadow (down if positive, up if negative)
blur-radius How soft the shadow edge is (0 = sharp edge)
color Color of the shadow

Example:
h1 {
text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

Can add multiple shadows by comma-separating:
text-shadow: 1px 1px 0 black, 2px 2px 4px gray;

box-shadow — Shadow on Elements (Boxes)
Syntax:
box-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur-radius spread-radius color inset;

Parts Explained:
offset-x Horizontal shift (right = +, left = –)
offset-y Vertical shift (down = +, up = –)
blur-radius Controls softness of the shadow's edge
spread-radius Expands/shrinks the shadow size
color Shadow color (can use rgba or named color)
inset (optional) Makes the shadow appear inside the box

Basic Example:
div {
box-shadow: 4px 4px 8px gray;
}
This will give a gray shadow that is offset 4px right and down, and blurred by 8px.

Advanced Example:
div {
box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
}
2px 2px → shifted down and right
5px → blurred
2px → spread (shadow is bigger than the element)
rgba(0,0,0,0.3) → 30% black

div {
box-shadow: inset 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
Appears like the element is “pressed in” — used in UI elements like buttons or cards.

How Shadows Are Rendered by Browsers
The element’s box or text is drawn. Then, the shadow is painted underneath or inside the element The blur is generated by spreading the color in all directions Shadows don’t take up layout space — they’re purely visual effects

Multiple Shadows
You can layer shadows for complex effects:

box-shadow:
2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.4),
-2px -2px 5px rgba(255,255,255,0.2);
This creates a dual light source feel — useful in neumorphism.

Common Use Cases
Emphasizing headings text-shadow Slight shadows make text pop
Card or tile effect box-shadow Adds depth and separation
Button press effect box-shadow inset Looks like a depressed surface
Floating UI feel box-shadow Simulates elevation
Neumorphism multiple box-shadow Dual light/dark shadows for 3D effect
