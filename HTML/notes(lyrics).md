The <pre> tag in HTML stands for preformatted text.
What it does:
Preserves spaces, tabs, and line breaks exactly as written in the HTML.

Renders text in a monospaced (fixed-width) font by default (like Courier).

Useful for displaying code, ASCII art, or formatted output.

Example:

<pre>
Name: John Doe
Age:  25
City: New York
</pre>

Will display exactly like:
Name: John Doe
Age: 25
City: New York

If you're displaying code, it's common to use <pre> together with <code>:

<pre><code>
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
</code></pre>
