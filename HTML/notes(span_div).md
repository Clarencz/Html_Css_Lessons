HTML <span> and <div>

1. Purpose of <div> and <span>
   Both are container elements used to group and organize content.

Tag Type Purpose

<div>	Block-level	Groups larger sections or blocks of content
<span>	Inline	Wraps short inline pieces like words or phrases

They don’t have visible effects by themselves — they're meant for structure and styling.

2. <div> – Block-Level Container
   Syntax:

<div>
  <h2>Product Info</h2>
  <p>This is a great product.</p>
</div>
Explanation:
Starts on a new line.
Takes up the full width of its parent container by default.
Used to group:
Articles
Sections
Forms
Layout areas

Example Use:

<div>
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>This is the homepage of our site.</p>
</div>
3. <span> – Inline Container
Syntax:

<p>This is a <span>highlighted</span> word.</p>
Explanation:
Does not break onto a new line.
Used to wrap and manipulate:
Single words
Short phrases
Symbols or icons
Doesn’t affect layout — just allows targeted changes.
Example Use:
<p>Hello, <span>John</span>!</p>

4.<div> vs <span> – Key Differences
Feature <div> <span>
Type Block-level Inline
Default Layout New line, full width Same line, inline size
Use Case Structure/layout sections Style inline text
Common With Layouts, forms, sections Styling, emphasis

5.  Why Use Them?
    Without CSS or JS, they do nothing visually — but they help you:
    Organize your code
    Apply styles or scripts later
    Control grouping (just like using folders for files)

6.  Attributes You Can Use
    Attribute Applies to Purpose
    id Both Unique identifier (used in JS/CSS)
    class Both Style multiple items the same way
    title Both Tooltip on hover
    data-\* Both Store custom data (used in JS)

Example:

<div id="menu" class="container">
  <span class="menu-item">Home</span>
  <span class="menu-item">About</span>
</div>
7. Common Mistakes
Using <span> for large blocks	Use <div> for block-level content
Nesting <div> inside <p>	Invalid HTML — use <div> outside block elements
Forgetting to close tags	Always close both <div> and <span>
Styling <div> without class/id	Give it a class or id so CSS/JS can find it
