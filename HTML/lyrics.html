            We're talking away
            I don't know I'm to say I'll say it anyway
            Today's another day to find you
            Shying away
            I'll be coming for your love, okay?
            Take on me (take on me)
            Take me on (take on me) 
            I'll be gone in a day or two
            So needless to say
            I'm odds and ends

            But I'll be stumbling away
            Slowly learning that life is okay
            Say after me
            It's no better to be safe than sorry

            Take on me (take on me)
            Take me on (take on me)
            I'll be gone in a day or two
            Oh, the things that you say
            
            Is it life or just to play my worries away?
